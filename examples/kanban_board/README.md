You can run this on your own.

Set the following environment variables:

- `PODIO_CLIENT_ID` - Your API key ID
- `PODIO_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your API client secret
- `PODIO_USERNAME` - Username to login to Podio
- `PODIO_PASSWORD` - Your account's password

You will be asked for your Org slug, this is the "citrix" in "podio.com/citrix/hello-world", have it ready.

Run `make` from this folder. It'll setup the local provider source, and terraform init.
